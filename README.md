ADMIN DASHBOARD

This is the Admin Dashboard that I reconstructed to complete the final project of The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML & CSS course. As was suggested, I exclusively used Grid to reconstruct the page in the design brief. 

The Dashboard is a simple, but clean design, which uses the so-called Holy Grail layout. The layout is constructed of a sidebar in the first column, as well as a header and content section in the second column, which is four times greater in size than the first column.

I learned a lot while completing this project, though I am aware that I did not always adhere to best practices. For example, I used negative margins in several places to achieve the desired result. This is something that I will continue improving on in the coming months.
